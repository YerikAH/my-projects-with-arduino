# Projects with arduino

In this exciting repository 🚀 you can explore all the fascinating projects I am carrying out with Arduino. 🤖💡 These projects will not only help you get familiar with various electronic components but also deeply understand the Arduino language and its libraries. Also, please note that I will stop updating this repository after completing three awesome projects:

- **🕷️ Remote Control Spider:** Transform Arduino into a thread master with this amazing spider that you can control remotely.

- **👋 Robotic hand that imitates my gestures:** Turn your gestures into actions with this unique robotic hand that follows your movements!

- **📱 Wireless Charger for Mobile Devices:** Forget about cables with this innovative charger that offers wireless charging for your mobile devices.

Each of these projects will be explained in detail in a README.md file and I will possibly create an interesting video documenting the entire process.
